*ingredients*
- handful of dried gosari
- cooking oil (canola or vegetable; high smoke point)
- lots of chopped garlic
- chopped green onion
- sesame oil
- sesame seeds (toasted preferred)
- soy sauce

*steps*

1. Soak the gosari over night. Change water a few times.
2. Boil the gosari until it doesn't taste bitter and is not chewy/hard
   anymore. It will take about 20-30 minutes.
3. Cut the gosari to 10 cm/3 in length, and set it aside.
4. Stir fry gosari with garlic and green onion.
5. Once it starts smelling fragrant, add soy sauce until it tastes
   good to you.
6. (optional) Add some water here to braising the gosari for a bit.
6. Drizzle sesame oil and sprinkle sesame seeds.

*notes*
- Gosari is toxic by default, which is the reason you want to change
  the water while soaking a few times.
- You don't want to fry using sesame oil, because the flavor will burn
  off, and it has a low smoke point.
