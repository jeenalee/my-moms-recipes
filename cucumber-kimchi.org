*** 오이소박이 (cucumber kimchi)

*ingredients*
- stuffing
  - 4 Tbsp chili flakes
  - 2 Tbsp fish sauce
  - 0.5 Tbsp cup salted shrimp
  - 1 Tbsp minced garlic
  - 1 Tbsp minced ginger
  - 1 Tbsp sugar
  - 1 bunch of asian chives (regular chives works too)
  - 1/2 sliced onions
- 4 Tbsp salt
- 7 Persian cucumbers (or 4-5 Korean cucumbers)

1. Cut the cucumbers in 2 inch long pieces. Quarter each piece, so you
   end up with 2 inch long sticks.
2. Boil 800ml water and add 4Tbsp salt. Once it's boiling, pour the
   salt water over the cucumbers. Let it soak for 30 minutes. Soaking
   the cucumbers in boiling water helps them stay crunchy.
3. Mix the ingredients for the stuffing. Once they're mixed, add the
   chives and onions. Make sure the ingredients are well mixed.
4. Once the cucumbers are ready, rince them in cold water, and mix
   with the stuffing.
